      <h1>The soft in software</h1>
      <p>
        We sometimes use the term <mark>hard coded</mark> when writing something
        like <code>const withTaxes = sum * 1.19</code>. The tax of 19% can
        change and if it does, we have to find all the spots where this number
        was used. In some cases the code might be written like this though:
        <code>const total = sum * 19 / 100</code>. So we would miss it if we
        searched the document for <i>1.19</i>. In this context most developers
        would recognize what the number 19 means. But it could also be something
        like this original piece of code from the source of
        <i>Quake III Arena</i>:
        <code> i = 0x5f3759df - ( i >> 1 ); // what the fuck?</code>
