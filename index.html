      <h1>The soft in software</h1>
      <p>
        We sometimes use the term <mark>hard coded</mark> when writing something
        like <code>const withTaxes = sum * 1.19</code>. The tax of 19% can
        change and if it does, we have to find all the spots where this number
        was used. In some cases the code might be written like this though:
        <code>const total = sum * 19 / 100</code>. So we would miss it if we
        searched the document for <i>1.19</i>.
